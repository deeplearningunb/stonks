# Stonks
Using deep learning to predict stock open and close prices.

## About
First of all we need to understand how the stocks market works.

### What is a stock?

A stock represents a fraction of the value of companies, so we can say that a stock is a small piece of a company. These stocks are traded in the stock exchange.

Nowadays, stocks are a type of investment that people are looking for, due to the great results they can present. However, the volatile of the stock market makes stock prices vary constantly. It brings several risks to investors.

On the other hand, this high frequency that stock prices changes is a feature enjoyed by those who invest in the stock market. These investors buy the stocks for a low price and sell for a higher price.

### How is our project related to this situation?

The Stonks project goal is to facilitate investor analysis of when is the right time to buy and sell stocks, since this neural network will be able to present predictions about the stocks opening and closing price.

In this way, Stonks will significantly help you achieve good results taking advantage of the  the market offers.
